Topics Focused on this Week:
Arrays
Basic math
Simple string manipulation
Simple bitwise manipulation
Hashmaps and sets
Union find

Note: Damaged my LeetCode profile by using  submissions to test my code
for the instances that it failed and reasoning why which led to bad number of
unaccepted submissions.
Will be more cautions and careful from now on.
