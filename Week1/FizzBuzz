/*I was considering using a check where
if  num is multiple of 3 then add Fizz then
if num is multiple of 5 then add Buzz which 
I feel would have been great for cout the results
but since I am making a vector if results instead I decided
to focus on speed so if FizzBuzz is the right word then the 
num must be divisible by 15 since 3*5=15
